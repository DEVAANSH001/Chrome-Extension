# Chrome Extension: PITCH - BLACK

This Chrome extension allows users to manage and toggle themes just for the specific site not all 

<h3> How It Works </h3>

When the extension is installed, it initializes the array as empty.<br>

When you toggle it on it extract the site domain and add it in the list<br> 

When a page loads, the extension checks if the site is in the list and applies the theme if it is.<br>

Users can add or remove the current site from the whitelist by clicking the toggle button, which updates the theme immediately.<br>

<h3>Toggle Theme Button:</h3>

A button allows users to toggle the theme for the current website.
Clicking the button adds or removes the site's domain from the whitelist.
The extension updates the stored whitelist and applies the theme change immediately.

Initialization on Installation:

When the extension is installed, it initializes the array as empty.
Use the "Toggle Theme" button to add or remove the current website from the whitelist.

Automatic Theme Application:
The extension automatically applies the theme to websites in the whitelist on page load.

<h3>Key Functions</h3>
Enable: Applies the theme to the website (e.g., enabling dark mode).
Disable: Reverts the website to its default theme (e.g., disabling dark mode).
Notes
Ensure the enable and disable functions are correctly defined to manage the theme changes.
The whitelist function stored in Chrome's synced storage, making it consistent across devices where the user is signed in.

<h3>Current Limitation:</h3>
The extension currently does not work with images and videos, but I plan to fix this issue in future updates.
